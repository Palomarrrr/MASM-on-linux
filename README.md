# MASM on Linux
I do not want to run Windows, however, my school is making us learn MASM instead of something more reasonable like NASM.

This should also work on macs but I don't have one to really test it on
## Reqirments
- Wine 32 bit
- A C compiler
- Wget
- Git
## Setup
Just run the script... that should be it

    # ./setup.sh

###### Note: 
You may have to change the C compiler used because for some reason I couldn't get `${CC}` to work
